Encoder and Decoder Based on Hamming code where the message is encoded into its corresponding binary code with parity bits added. This Encoded code can detect and correct one bit errors  

The data to be encoded is given in  input.txt. The Encoder.py converts the data in input.txt to corresponding encoded values and stores it in encoded.txt If there is  one bit changes in the encoded.txt decoder.py detects, corrects and correctly decodes the data.
